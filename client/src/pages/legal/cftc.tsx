                HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. 
                NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. 
                IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS 
                SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.

              <p className="font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">
                ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT 
                OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL 
                TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING.

              <p className="font-bold text-gray-700 mb-0">
                FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING 
                LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER 
                FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH 
                CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN 
                ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Hypothetical trading results are often prepared with the benefit of hindsight. This means that the 
                  strategy or approach may have been developed or refined after the fact, with knowledge of how the 
                  markets actually performed during the time period being analyzed. In actual trading, traders do not 
                  have this advantage and must make decisions based on current market conditions and projections of 
                  future market behavior.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Hypothetical trading does not involve actual financial risk. When trading with real money, emotional 
                  factors such as fear of loss or excitement over potential profits can significantly impact trading 
                  decisions. These psychological factors are absent in hypothetical trading scenarios, which can lead 
                  to significant differences between hypothetical results and actual trading performance.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Hypothetical results may not fully account for various market factors that can affect actual trading, 
                  such as liquidity, slippage, and the ability to execute trades at desired prices. In real trading, 
                  these factors can significantly impact results, especially during volatile market conditions or 
                  when trading less liquid markets.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Hypothetical results may assume perfect implementation of a trading system or strategy. In reality, 
                  there may be delays in executing trades, errors in following the strategy, or technical issues with 
                  the trading platform that can affect actual trading results. Additionally, the strategy itself may 
                  perform differently in real-time market conditions than it did in backtested scenarios.
