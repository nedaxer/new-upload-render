              Nadex operates under the regulatory oversight of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), 
              which ensures our exchange maintains the highest standards of market integrity, transparency, and

              As a regulated exchange, Nadex must comply with strict financial requirements, reporting obligations,

            <p className="mb-4">
              One of the most important customer protections at Nadex is the segregation of member funds. 
              This means your money is held in dedicated accounts at top-tier US banks, completely separate 
              from Nadex's operating funds.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              This segregation provides a critical layer of protection, ensuring your funds are used only 
              for your trading activities and are not exposed to the business risks of the exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nadex maintains detailed records of all member funds and undergoes regular audits to ensure 
              compliance with regulatory requirements for fund segregation.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#0033a0]">Limited Risk Products</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              All products offered on Nadex are designed with limited risk characteristics. This means:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li>Your maximum possible loss is known before you enter a trade</li>
              <li>You can never lose more than the capital you commit to each trade</li>

              <li>Your risk is limited to your initial cost or collateral</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This built-in risk limitation is a fundamental customer protection that distinguishes 
              Nadex from many other trading venues.
