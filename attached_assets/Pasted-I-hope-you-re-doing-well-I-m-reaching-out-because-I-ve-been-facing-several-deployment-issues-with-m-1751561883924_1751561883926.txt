I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out because I’ve been facing several deployment issues with my Nedaxer Trading Platform project when trying to deploy it on Render. I would appreciate your help to audit and restructure the project to avoid these problems and ensure smooth builds and deployments.

Here’s a summary of the main issues I’ve encountered:

1. The current monorepo setup has mixed dependencies and unclear separation between frontend (client/) and backend (server/) folders, causing build confusion.


2. Some essential dependencies like autoprefixer are missing or not installed in the correct folders, leading to build errors.


3. PostCSS config throws module type warnings because the root package.json lacks "type": "module", or the config file isn’t recognized properly.


4. The render.yaml deployment configuration needs to be correctly set up with the right build and start commands, environment variables, and autoDeploy settings.


5. Workspace configurations and package-lock.json conflicts are causing inconsistent dependency installs.


6. Deprecated packages and outdated versions (e.g., glob, rimraf) need to be updated to supported versions.


7. node_modules should not be committed to GitHub; instead, proper package.json and lock files should be used, with fresh installs during build.


8. Scripts in package.json must be properly defined for both frontend and backend builds and starts.


9. Environment variables should be correctly configured and loaded.


10. Overall, the project file structure should be clean and clear so that Render can build and run the app without errors.



Could you please:

Audit and restructure the project files and folders for a clear frontend/backend separation

Update all package.json files with correct dependencies and scripts

Fix or add the render.yaml file to support Render’s deployment requirements

Update deprecated packages to their latest stable versions

Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly and consistently without workspace conflicts

Test building and deploying on Render to verify everything works as expected

Provide me with any additional recommendations or changes needed


Thank you very much for your assistance! Please let me know if you need any further details or access.
