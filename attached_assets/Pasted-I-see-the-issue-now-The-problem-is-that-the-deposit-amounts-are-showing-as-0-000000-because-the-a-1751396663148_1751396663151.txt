I see the issue now. The problem is that the deposit amounts are showing as "0.000000" because the admin deposit creation is not properly handling the crypto amounts. The display is showing zero crypto amounts with the correct USD amounts. Let me fix this by examining the admin deposit creation system.


Executed pkill -f "tsx server/index.ts"
Now let me restart the workflow and examine the deposit creation system:


Restarted Start application
Let me examine the admin deposit creator to understand why the crypto amounts are showing as zero:


Opened client/src/components/admin-deposit-creator.tsx
Now let me check the backend deposit creation API to see how it's handling the crypto amounts:

I can see the issue now. The problem is in the assets history display logic. The deposit transactions are being created with correct crypto amounts, but the assets history page is displaying "0.000000" for the crypto amounts. Let me examine the assets history page to see how it's displaying the deposit data:


Opened client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
Let me look at the transaction display component to see how it renders the crypto amounts:


Opened client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx

Opened client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
I found the issue! The problem is on line 352 where the assets history page is displaying +{(transaction.cryptoAmount || 0).toFixed(6)}. The transaction.cryptoAmount is likely undefined or null for some deposits, which is why it's showing as 0.000000.

Let me check what's happening in the database and the deposit creation API. The issue might be that the deposits being created by the admin don't have the correct cryptoAmount field.


Executed grep -n "cryptoAmount" server/routes.mongo.ts
I need to investigate why the cryptoAmount is showing as 0.000000 in the assets history. Let me check the deposit creation process more carefully. The backend is calculating cryptoAmount = usdAmount / cryptoPrice, but there might be an issue with how this is being stored or retrieved.

Let me check the deposit details page to see what data it's actually receiving:


Opened client/src/pages/mobile/deposit-details.tsx
Let me check the actual data structure being returned by the deposits API to understand why cryptoAmount is showing as 0:


Executed curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:5000/api/deposits/history 2>/dev/null | head -c 500
I need to examine the database directly to see the actual structure of the deposit data. Let me create a debug script to check what's in the database:


Edited debug-deposit-amounts.js

Executed node debug-deposit-amounts.js
The database shows the deposit transactions have correct cryptoAmount values (like 150, 1000, 500), but the assets history is displaying them as 0.000000. This suggests there's a data retrieval or display issue.

Looking at the MongoDB data, the cryptoAmount values are stored as whole numbers (150, 1000, 500) instead of decimal values. The issue is likely in how the display code is handling these values or there's a mismatch between what's stored and what's expected.

Let me check the deposit history API endpoint to see what data it's actually returning:
