Regulations
Trading on a secure, regulated US exchange with robust customer protections

Regulatory Oversight
Nadex operates under the regulatory oversight of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which ensures our exchange maintains the highest standards of market integrity, transparency, and customer protection.

As a regulated exchange, Nadex must comply with strict financial requirements, reporting obligations, and operating procedures designed to protect market participants and maintain a fair trading environment.

CFTC Regulation
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the primary regulator of derivatives markets in the United States, overseeing exchanges like Nadex to ensure market integrity and customer protection.

Designated Contract Market (DCM)
Nadex is registered as a Designated Contract Market (DCM), which allows us to offer regulated derivative products to retail traders in the United States.

Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
Nadex implements robust AML procedures including identity verification, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting to prevent financial crimes.

Segregated Funds
Member funds are held in segregated accounts at top-tier US banks, separate from Nadex's operating funds, providing an additional layer of protection.

Customer Protection
Segregated Funds
One of the most important customer protections at Nadex is the segregation of member funds. This means your money is held in dedicated accounts at top-tier US banks, completely separate from Nadex's operating funds.

This segregation provides a critical layer of protection, ensuring your funds are used only for your trading activities and are not exposed to the business risks of the exchange.

Nadex maintains detailed records of all member funds and undergoes regular audits to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for fund segregation.

Limited Risk Products
All products offered on Nadex are designed with limited risk characteristics. This means:

Your maximum possible loss is known before you enter a trade
You can never lose more than the capital you commit to each trade
There are no margin calls
Your risk is limited to your initial cost or collateral
This built-in risk limitation is a fundamental customer protection that distinguishes Nadex from many other trading venues.
