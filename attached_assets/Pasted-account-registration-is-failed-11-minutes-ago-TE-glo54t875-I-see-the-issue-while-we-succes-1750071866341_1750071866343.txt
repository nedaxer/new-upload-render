I see the issue - while we successfully connected to your MySQL database, the database tables haven't been created yet. The error shows that the users table doesn't exist in your database. Let me create all the necessary tables for your trading platform.


Executed npm run db:push
I need to create the database tables since the Drizzle push command failed. Let me create all the necessary tables directly in your MySQL database using SQL commands.


Agent ran into an error
I need to create the database tables manually since the SQL tool is trying to connect to PostgreSQL instead of your MySQL database. Let me create a script to initialize your MySQL database with all the necessary tables.


Created scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
Now I'll run the script to create all the necessary database tables for your trading platform:


Executed node scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
I need to fix the MySQL connection issue and create the database tables. Let me update the script to use the correct MySQL connection method:


Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js

Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
Now I'll run the updated script to create the database tables:


Executed node scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
I need to fix the MySQL table creation issue. The problem is that MySQL doesn't allow TEXT columns to have default values. Let me update the script to use VARCHAR instead of TEXT for columns that need defaults.


Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
I'll update the other tables to use proper VARCHAR types and run the script again to create all the database tables.


Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js

I'll update the remaining table structures to fix the MySQL compatibility issues and create all the database tables.


Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
Now I'll run the updated script to create all the database tables:


Executed node scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
I need to fix the JSON column issue for older MySQL versions. Let me replace JSON with TEXT and update the remaining table structures.


Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
I'll update the remaining table structures to fix the MySQL compatibility issues and complete the database setup.


Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js

Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
I'll run the script again to create the remaining database tables:


Executed node scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
I need to fix the MySQL timestamp issue. The problem is that older MySQL versions only allow one TIMESTAMP column with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP default per table. Let me update the script to fix this issue:


Edited scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
Let me run the corrected script to create the remaining database tables:


Executed node scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
I'll fix the timestamp issue by removing the problematic default value and create a simplified version that works with your MySQL database version.

Now I'll run the corrected script to create the remaining database tables:


Executed node scripts/create-mysql-tables.js
Perfect! All database tables have been created successfully. Now let me test the registration functionality to confirm your account registration issue is resolved.


Executed curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "username": "testuser@example.com", "email": "testuser@example.com", "password": "testpass123", "firstName": "Test", "lastName": "User" }' | head -5
I see the issue - the database tables are created but the code is still using PostgreSQL-specific syntax for inserting data. Let me fix the storage layer to work with MySQL.


Opened server/storage.ts
I need to fix the MySQL compatibility issue in the storage layer. The .returning() method doesn't work with MySQL in Drizzle ORM.


Edited server/storage.ts
I need to add the missing import for the eq function that's used in the MySQL storage operations. Let me fix this import issue:


Opened server/storage.ts
Good! The imports are correct. Now let me test the registration again to see if the MySQL compatibility fix resolved the issue:


Executed curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "username": "testuser2@example.com", "email": "testuser2@example.com", "password": "testpass123", "firstName": "Test", "lastName": "User" }'
I see the issue is still persisting. Let me check if the updated code is actually being used by restarting the server and examining the exact error more closely.


Restarted Start application
Let me test the registration again after the server restart:


Executed curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "username": "testuser3@example.com", "email": "testuser3@example.com", "password": "testpass123", "firstName": "Test", "lastName": "User" }'
I see the issue now - the insertId is returning NaN. This is a MySQL driver compatibility issue. Let me fix the storage implementation to properly handle MySQL's insert result.


Edited server/storage.ts
I need to fix the MySQL insert result handling. Let me correct the insertId access pattern for MySQL with Drizzle ORM.


Edited server/storage.ts
I need to test the registration with your actual account details to see if the database tables are working correctly. Let me try creating a test account first to verify the system works:


Executed curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "username": "testuser4@example.com", "email": "testuser4@example.com", "password": "testpass123", "firstName": "Test", "lastName": "User" }'
