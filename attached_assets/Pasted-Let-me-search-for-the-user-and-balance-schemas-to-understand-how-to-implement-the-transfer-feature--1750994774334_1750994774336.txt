Let me search for the user and balance schemas to understand how to implement the transfer feature.


Searched for "Find MongoDB user models and balance system implementation"
Now let me check the current quick actions section in the assets page to understand how to add the transfer feature.


Opened client/src/pages/mobile/assets.tsx
Now let me look at the quick actions section to understand where to add the transfer feature.


Opened client/src/pages/mobile/assets.tsx
I can see there's already a transfer button in the assets page. Now let me create a professional transfer page that allows users to send USD to other users via email or UID. I'll:

First create the transfer page component
Add API endpoints for transferring funds between users
Create a transaction model to track transfers
Add route to the mobile app
Let me start by creating the transfer page:


Created client/src/pages/mobile/transfer.tsx
Now let me add the transfer route to the mobile app:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Now let me add the Transfer page import and route to the mobile app:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now let me find where to add the route for the transfer page:

Let me look for the mobile routes section:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Now let me add the transfer route to the mobile routes section:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now I need to create the API endpoints for searching users and transferring funds. Let me first create a Transfer model to track the transaction history:


Created server/models/Transfer.ts
Let me create the API routes for the transfer functionality:

Let me search for the existing wallet routes:


Searched for "Find wallet API routes and endpoints"
Now let me add the transfer endpoints to the server routes:


Opened server/routes.mongo.ts
Let me add the transfer endpoints to the server routes. I need to find where other API endpoints are defined:


Opened server/routes.mongo.ts
Let me add the transfer endpoints to the routes.mongo.ts file. I'll insert them right after the wallet endpoints:


Opened server/routes.mongo.ts

Edited server/routes.mongo.ts
Now let me restart the workflow to apply the changes:


Restarted Start application
Now let me add the transfer tab to the assets history page to allow users to see their transfer history:


Opened client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
Let me check for the existing transfer history endpoint and also add transfer functionality to the assets history page:


Opened client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
Now I need to add transfer history functionality. Let me create an endpoint to fetch transfer history and update the assets history page to show transfers:


Edited server/routes.mongo.ts
Now let me update the assets history page to include transfer history in addition to deposits:


Edited client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
I see there's an error in the Transfer page. Let me fix it:


Edited client/src/pages/mobile/transfer.tsx
Let me also fix the errors in the assets history page:


Edited client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
Now let me update the assets history page to properly display transfer transactions. I need to fix the transaction rendering to handle both deposits and transfers:

Let me check the current transaction rendering section in the assets history page:


Opened client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
I need to properly update the transactions display to handle both deposits and transfers. Let me fix this:


Edited client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
Now I need to update the empty state message and also create the websocket module since it's missing. First, let me fix the empty state message:


Edited client/src/pages/mobile/assets-history.tsx
Now I need to create the websocket module that's missing:


Created server/websocket.ts
Now let me update the replit.md file to document the new transfer feature:


Edited replit.md
